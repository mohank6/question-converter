Fiscal Deficit: the difference between total expenditure and total revenue receipts and capital receipts but excluding borrowings and other liabilities, or it is the Sum of Budget deficit plus Borrowings and other Liabilities. The situation of fiscal deficit indicates that the government is spending beyond its means. To be simpler, we may say that the government is spending more than its income (though in practice all receipts of the government are not income. Basically, receipts are all forms of money accruing to the government, be it income or borrowings). The fiscal deficit excluding the interest liabilities for a year is the primary deficit, a term India started using since the fiscal 1997–98. It shows the fiscal deficit for the year in which the economy had not to fulfil any interest payments on the different loans and liabilities which it is obliged to—shown both in quantitative and percentage of GDP forms.

Printing Currency is the last resort for the government in managing its deficit. But it has the biggest handicap that with it the government cannot go for the expenditures which are to be made in the foreign currency. Even if the government is satisfied on this front, printing fresh currencies does have other damaging effects on the economy: It increases inflation proportionally.

FDI is calculated to include all kinds of capital contributions, such as the purchases of stocks, as well as the reinvestment of earnings by a wholly owned company incorporated abroad (subsidiary), and the lending of funds to a foreign subsidiary or branch. The reinvestment of earnings and transfer of assets between a parent company and its subsidiary often constitutes a significant part of FDI calculations. FDI is more difficult to pull out or sell off. Consequently, direct investors may be more committed to managing their international investments, and less likely to pull out at the first sign of trouble.

Unlike FDI, it is very easy to sell off the securities and pull out the foreign portfolio investment. Hence, FPI can be much more volatile than FDI. For a country on the rise, FPI can bring about rapid development, helping an emerging economy move quickly to take advantage of economic opportunity, creating many new jobs and significant wealth.

Likewise, the less an activity is taxed, the more of it is generated. Laffer argues that the more money taken from a business in the form of taxes, the less money it has to invest in the business. A business is more likely to find ways to protect its capital from taxation, or to relocate all or a part of its operations overseas. Investors are less likely to risk their own capital if a larger percentage of their profits are taken.

The government views them with suspicion as some of them could be used for money laundering, tax evasion and other illegal activities. How to strike off a shell company from the records?

Voluntary closure can be done with the approval of the board and shareholders and the firm should have nil liabilities. Scenarios leading to the Strike off: The strike off happens in case of companies which have failed to commence business within a year of incorporation. Also, in case of companies that are not carrying on any business or operation for a period of two immediately preceding financial years and have not made any application within such period for obtaining the status of a ‘dormant company’ under Section 455 of the Companies Act can be struck off by the RoC unless cause is shown to the contrary.

Production units in an economy are classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. On the basis of this classification, value-added method is used to measure national income. b. Economy is also viewed as a combination of individuals and households owing different kinds of factors of production. On the basis of this combination, income method is used for estimating national income. c. Economy is viewed as a collection of units used for consumption, saving, and investment. On the basis of this collection, final expenditure method is used for calculating national income. 1. Value-added Method: Value added method, also called net output method, is used to measure the contribution of an economy’s production units to the GDPmp . In other words, value-added method measures value added by each industry in an economy. For calculating national income through value- added method, it is necessary to first calculate gross value added at market price ( GVAmp ), net value added at market price ( NVAmp ), and net value added at factor cost ( NVAfc ). 2. Income Method: Income method, also known as factor income method, is used to calculate all income accrued to the basic factors of production used in producing national product. Traditionally, there are four factors of production, namely land, labor, capital, and organization. Accordingly there are four factor payments, namely rent, compensation of employees, interest, and profit. There is another category of factor payment called mixed income. 3. Final Expenditure Method: Final expenditure method, also known as final product method, is used to measure final expenditures incurred by production units for producing final goods and services within an economic territory during a given time period. These expenditures are incurred on consumption and investment. This method is the opposite of the value-added method.

It is a position in the government which cannot be held by an MLA or an MP. The post can yield salaries, perquisites and other benefits. The origin of this term can be found in the English Act of Settlement, 1701. Under this law, \"no person who has an office or place of profit under the King, or receives a pension from the Crown, shall be capable of serving as a member of the House of Commons.\" This was instituted so that there wouldn't be any undue influence from the royal household in administrative affairs. If an MLA or an MP holds a government office and receives benefits from it, then that office is termed as an \"office of profit\". A person will be disqualified if he holds an office of profit under the central or state government, other than an office declared not to disqualify its holder by a law passed by Parliament or state legislature. The word ‘office’ has not been defined in the Constitution or the Representation of the People Act of 1951. But different courts have interpreted it to mean a position with certain duties that are more or less of public character. Why should an MLA or an MP not hold an office of profit? According to Articles 102(1)(a) and 191(1)(a) of the Constitution, an MP or MLA is barred from holding an office of profit as it can put them in a position to gain a financial benefit. \"A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either House of Parliament, (a) if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder,\" says the law. Under the Representation of People Act too, holding an office of profit is grounds for disqualification. What is the underlying principle for including ‘office of profit’ as criterion for disqualification? Makers of the Constitution wanted that legislators should not feel obligated to the Executive in any way, which could influence them while discharging legislative functions. In other words, an MP or MLA should be free to carry out her duties without any kind of governmental pressure. What do parliamentary secretaries do?

The qualitative or selective methods of credit control are adopted by the Central Bank in its pursuit of economic stabilisation and as part of credit management. (i) Margin Requirements: The commercial banks generally advance loans to their customers against some security or securities offered by the borrower and acceptable to banks. Generally, the commercial banks do not lend up to the full amount of the security but lend an amount less than its value. Margin requirement is the minimum amount of money that a client must have on deposit, either in cash or approved securities, to access a loan. The margin requirements against specific securities are determined by the Central Bank. A change in margin requirements will influence the flow of credit. A rise in the margin requirement results in a contraction in the borrowing value of the security and similarly, a fall in the margin requirement results in expansion in the borrowing value of the security. (ii) Credit Rationing: Rationing of credit is a method by which the Central Bank seeks to limit the maximum amount of loans and advances and, also in certain cases, fix ceiling for specific categories of loans and advances. (iii) Regulation of Consumer Credit: Regulation of consumer credit is designed to check the flow of credit for consumer durable goods. This can be done by regulating the total volume of credit that may be extended for purchasing specific durable goods and regulating the number of instalments through which such loan can be spread. Central Bank uses this method to restrict or liberalise loan conditions accordingly to stabilise the economy.", "Qno": 1151}, "Q1152": {"statement": "Consider the following statements related to Disguised Unemployment: 1.

Most tectonic activity in the Ring of Fire occurs in these geologically active zones. Most of the active volcanoes on the Ring of fire are found on its western edge because the Pacific plate is moving towards west (towards the islands of Japan and south east Asia and New Zealand) every year. The Pacific plate is old, cold, ocean crust, so it’s quite dense and heavy. When it counters other tectonic plates, it has the tendency to sink.

Areti is a glacial landform and not a periglacial landform. It could have been eliminated. Periglacial Landform Periglaciation (adjective: \"periglacial,\" also referring to places at the edges of glacial areas) describes geomorphic processes that result from seasonal thawing of snow in areas of permafrost, the runoff from which refreezes in ice wedges and other structures. \"Periglacial\" suggests an environment located on the margin of past glaciers. However, freeze and thaw cycles influence landscapes outside areas of past glaciation. Therefore, periglacial environments are anywhere that freezing and thawing modify the landscape in a significant manner. Periglaciation results in a variety of ground conditions but especially those involving irregular, mixed deposits created by ice wedges, solifluction, gelifluction, frost creep and rockfalls. Periglacial environments trend towards stable geomorphologies. #Coombe and head deposits – Coombe deposits are chalk deposits found below chalk escarpments in Southern England. Head deposits are more common below outcrops of granite on Dartmoor. #Patterned Ground – Patterned ground occurs where stones form circles, polygons and stripes. Local topography affects which of these are expressed. A process called frost heaving is responsible for these features. #Solifluction lobes – Solifluction lobes are formed when waterlogged soil slips down a slope due to gravity forming U shaped lobes. #Blockfields or Felsenmeer – Blockfields are areas covered by large angular blocks, traditionally believed to have been created by freeze-thaw action. A good example of a blockfield can be found in the Snowdonia National Park, Wales.

The moon appears new (dark) when it is directly between the Earth and the sun. The moon appears full when the Earth is between the moon and the sun.

Rather, the term is derived from the concept of the tide \"springing forth.\" Spring tides occur twice each lunar month all year long, without regard to the season. Seven days after a spring tide, the sun and moon are at right angles to each other.

Subtropical high, one of several regions of semi-permanent high atmospheric pressure located over the oceans between 20° and 40° of latitude in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the Earth. These highs are associated with the subsidence of the Hadley cell and move several degrees of latitude toward the poles in the summer. In both hemispheres, subsidence is greater on the eastern sides of the highs. The subsiding air warms by compression and, coupled with cooling of the lowest layers overlying the cold ocean currents normally found off the west coasts of the continents, forms a pronounced temperature inversion (warm air over cold), called the trade-wind inversion.

The farmer owns a small piece of land, grows crops with the help of his family members and consumes almost the entire farm produce with little surplus to sell in the market. Pressure of population on agriculture: The population in India is increasing at a rapid pace and exerts heavy pressure on agriculture. Agriculture has to provide employment to a large section of work force and has to feed the teeming millions. Importance of animals: Animal force has always played a significant role in agricultural operations such as ploughing, irrigation, threshing and transporting the agricultural products. Complete mechanisation of Indian agriculture is still a distant goal and animals will continue to dominate the agricultural scene in India for several years to come. Dependent upon Monsoon: Indian agriculture is mainly dependent upon monsoon which is uncertain, unreliable and irregular. In spite of the large scale expansion of irrigation facilities since Independence, only one-third of the cropped area is provided by perennial irrigation and the remaining two- third of the cropped area has to bear the brunt of the vagaries of the monsoons. Predominance of food crops: Since Indian agriculture has to feed a large population, production of food crops is the first priority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country. More than two-thirds of the total cropped area is devoted to the cultivation of food crops. Insignificant place to given fodder crops: Although India has the largest population of livestock in the world, fodder crops are given a very insignificant place in our cropping pattern. Only four per cent of the reporting area is devoted to permanent pastures and other grazing lands. This is due to pressing demand of land for food crops. The result is that the domestic animals are not properly fed and their productivity is very low compared to international standards. Seasonal pattern: India has three major crop seasons. (i) Kharif season starts with the onset of monsoons and continues till the beginning of winter. Major crops of this season are rice, maize, jowar, bajra, cotton, sesamum, groundnut and pulses such as moong, urad, etc. (ii) Rabi season starts at the beginning of winter and continues till the end of winter or beginning of summer. Major crops of this season are wheat, barley, jowar, gram and oil seeds such as linseed, rape and mustard. (iii) Zaid is summer cropping season in which crops like rice, maize, groundnut, vegetables and fruits are grown. Now some varieties of pulses have been evolved which can be successfully grown in summer. Small Landholdings More than 80% of India’s farmers are small and marginalized with less than 1 hectare of land.

For instance a town plan, which is a large scale map, might be on a scale of 1:10,000, whereas the world map, which is a small scale map, might be on a scale of 1:100,000,000. The following table describes typical ranges for these scales but should not be considered authoritative because there is no standard: Classification Range Examples large scale 1:0 – 1:600,000 1:0.00001 for map of virus; 1:5,000 for walking map of town medium scale 1:600,000 – 1:2,000,000 Map of a country small scale 1:2,000,000 – 1:∞ 1:50,000,000 for world map; 1:1021 for map of galaxy The terms are sometimes used in the absolute sense of the table, but other times in a relative sense. For example, a map reader whose work refers solely to large-scale maps (as tabulated above) might refer to a map at 1:500,000 as small-scale. In the English language, the word large-scale is often used to mean \"extensive\". However, as explained above, cartographers use the term \"large scale\" to refer to less extensive maps – those that show a smaller area. Maps that show an extensive area are \"small scale\" maps.

Large land areas are needed for this type of agriculture. Countries that have plantation agriculture usually experience high annual temperatures and receive high annual rainfall. Plantation agriculture as mentioned above was introduced by the Europeans in colonies situated in the tropics. Some of the important plantation crops are tea, coffee, cocoa, rubber, cotton, oil palm, sugarcane, bananas and pineapples. The plantation has an interface of agriculture and industry. Plantations cover large tracts of land, using capital intensive inputs, with the help of migrant labourers. All the produce is used as raw material in respective industries. PURPOSE -Plantation agriculture is a form of commercial farming where crops are grown for sale. Some crops are sold as raw materials to manufacturing industries. INPUTS: Land: Plantations are huge and can extend from a few hectares to a few thousand hectares. For example, in Malaysia, an oil palm plantation is usually at least 40 hectares in size. Capital: A large amount of capital is put into building roads, buying machinery and building factories to process the crops harvested from the plantations. Plantation owners also invest large amounts of their capital on fertilizers and pesticides. Fertilizers are applied to plantation crops as frequently as these crops use up nutrients from the land quickly. Since plantations usually grow one type of crop, pest attacks can cause total destruction of the plantations. Pesticides are therefore used in huge quantities to prevent crops from being entirely destroyed by pests. Labour: Due to the large size of a plantation, a lot of labour is needed to tend to the crops and work in the nearby processing factories. For example in Malaysia’s large rubber plantations, many workers are hired to tap latex from rubber trees. PRODUCE: #The total output of a plantation is usually high. However, as a plantation covers a wide area of land, its output per unit is usually low. #Usually, only one type p crop is grown in a plantation.

The theory was proposed in 1929 by the American demographer Warren Thompson, who observed changes, or transitions, in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the previous 200 years. The transition involves four stages, or possibly five. #In stage one, pre-industrial society, death rates and birth rates are high and roughly in balance. All human populations are believed to have had this balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe. In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% at least since the Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago. Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates. #In stage two, that of a developing country, the death rates drop quickly due to improvements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and reduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective breeding and crop rotation and farming techniques. Other improvements generally include access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous improvements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality. Prior to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily in the areas of food handling, water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene. One of the variables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health education programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In Europe, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern Europe and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years. Without a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an imbalance, and the countries in this stage experience a large increase in population. #In stage three, birth rates fall due to various fertility factors such as access to contraception, increases in wages, urbanization, a reduction in subsistence agriculture, an increase in the status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes. Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe. While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, it should be noted that contraceptives were not generally available or widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then. It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; not just because of the availability of contraceptives. #During stage four there are both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may drop to well below replacement level as has happened in countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan, leading to a shrinking population, a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high obesity and an aging population in developed countries. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates. #Some scholars break out, from stage four, a \"stage five\" of below-replacement fertility levels. Others hypothesize a different \"stage five\" involving an increase in fertility. As with all models, this is an idealized picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. The extent to which it applies to less-developed societies today remains to be seen. Many countries such as China, Brazil and Thailand have passed through the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic change.

The heat released to the atmosphere warms the air around. The air tends to rise and causes a drop in pressure. More air rushes to the centre of the storm. This Cycle is repeated. The chain of events ends with the formation of a very low-pressure system with very high-speed winds revolving around it.

Use of Early Maturing Varieties Early maturing varieties of crops take less time to mature and thus put lesser pressure on the soil. In this way it can help in reducing the soil erosion. Contour Ploughing If ploughing is done at right angles to the hill slope, the ridges and furrows break the flow of water down the hill. This prevents excessive soil loss as gullies are less likely to develop and also reduce run-off so that plants receive more water. Strip Cropping Crops may be cultivated in alternate strips, parallel to one another. Some strips may be allowed to lie fallow while in others different crops may be sown. Various crops are harvested at different intervals. This ensures that at no time of the year the entire area is left bare or exposed. The tall growing crops act as wind breaks and the strips which are often parallel to the contours help in increasing water absorption by the soil by slowing down run off. Crop Rotation Adopting sustainable agricultural practices is the most important measure to conserve soil. In many parts of India, a particular crop is sown in the same field year after year. This practice leads to exhaustion of certain nutrients in the soil making it infertile. Crop rotation is a practice in which a different crop is cultivated on a piece of land each year. This helps to conserve soil fertility as different crops require different nutrients from the soil. Crop rotation will provide enough time to restore lost nutrients. For example, potatoes require much potash, but wheat requires nitrate.

Sedimentary Sedimentary rocks are formed from particles of sand, shells, pebbles, and other fragments of material. Together, all these particles are called sediment. Gradually, the sediment accumulates in layers and over a long period of time hardens into rock. Generally, sedimentary rock is fairly soft and may break apart or crumble easily. You can often see sand, pebbles, or stones in the rock, and it is usually the only type that contains fossils. Examples of this rock type include conglomerate and limestone. Metamorphic Metamorphic rocks are formed under the surface of the earth from the metamorphosis (change) that occurs due to intense heat and pressure (squeezing). The rocks that result from these processes often have ribbonlike layers and may have shiny crystals, formed by minerals growing slowly over time, on their surface. Examples of this rock type include gneiss and marble. Igneous Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock deep within the earth) cools and hardens. Sometimes the magma cools inside the earth, and other times it erupts onto the surface from volcanoes (in this case, it is called lava). When lava cools very quickly, no crystals form and the rock looks shiny and glasslike. Sometimes gas bubbles are trapped in the rock during the cooling process, leaving tiny holes and spaces in the rock. Examples of this rock type include basalt and obsidian. Intrusive igneous rocks get more time to cool down. This gives time to crystal to grow bigger. On the other hand extrusive rocks cool down soon and small crystal formation is there.", "Qno": 1353}, "Q1354": {"statement": "Consider the following statements: 1.

Parent material This is the material from which the soil has developed. The parent material can influence the soil in a number of ways: colour; texture; structure; mineral composition and permeability/drainage. Climate The absorption of the solar radiation at the soil surface is affected by many variables such as soil color, vegetation cover, and aspect. In general, the darker the soil color, the more radiation is absorbed and the lower the albedo. The absorption differs in areas with deciduous trees (soil surface is shaded by trees most of the year) and arable land (soil surface is not shaded throughout the year). Biological processes are intensified by rising temperatures. Reaction rates are roughly doubled for each 10°C rise in temperature, although enzyme-catalyzed reactions are sensitive to high temperatures and usually attain a maximum between 30 and 35°C. Biological Factors The soil and the organisms living on and in it comprise an ecosystem. The active components of the soil ecosystem are the vegetation, fauna, including microorganisms, and man. Earthworms are the most important of the soil forming fauna in temperate regions, being supported to a variable extent by the small arthropods and the larger burrowing animals (rabbits, moles). Time Time is a factor in the interactions of all the above factors as they develop soil. Topography/Relief Relief is not static; it is a dynamic system (its study is called geomorphology).

This phenomenon is called western intensification because it occurs on the western side of the sub-tropical gyres. There are a number of reasons for it – the main being Coriolis effect. The Coriolis effect is greater in higher latitudes, the eastward moving high latitude current flow is deflected back toward the equator more strongly than the westward moving equatorial current flow which is deflected toward the poles.

Fishes in turn provide food to the sea birds. Due to all this, not only there is a good catch of fishes but also good collection of the Guano, the bird excreta, used as a valuable fertilizer. This is what that made Peru number one fishing nation in the world by the early 1970s. Due to El-Nino, the trade winds reverse direction, blowing from west to east.

Population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and distribution of a population, partly because of the very clear image these pyramids represent. A great deal of information about the population broken down by age and sex can be read from a population pyramid, and this can shed light on the extent of development and other aspects of the population. A population pyramid also tells how many people of each age range live in the area. There tends to be more females than males in the older age groups, due to females' longer life expectancy. Population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low fertility rate. The population pyramid here indicates stage 2 on the demographic transition. The broad base of the pyramid means the majority of population lies between ages 0–14, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population sub-replacement fertility level.

It formed due to freezing of water droplets from fog onto cold surfaces; includes artificial snow; crystals tend to be larger than in snow. • Hail: Hail is a form of solid precipitation. It consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice, each of which is referred to as a hail stone. Hail is associated with Cumulo-nimbus cloud and is the result of active turbulence/vertical currents. Hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds, particularly those with intense updrafts, high liquid water content, great vertical extent, large water droplets, and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0°C (32°F). These types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado.

Sleet occurs during winter weather and is a type of winter precipitation. All precipitation falls out of a cloud as snow. In certain instances, in the winter, the snowflake will go through a warmer layer and begin to melt. As it continues to fall, it will then proceed through a colder layer and freeze into an ice pellet or ball, very similar to hail. Unlike hail, the pellet only \"falls\" once and is generally very tiny in size. • Snow: Snow is formed when temperatures are low and there is moisture in the atmosphere in the form of tiny ice crystals.

(C) Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. (D) It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.", "hint": "Climate requirement: Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north, beyond even the 60 degree north altitude. Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring. It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters. The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 C. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing. Wheat requires a fairly warm temperature, but the period of heat should not be long as grains can ripen quickly. When temperatures are high, too much energy is lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India. Soil requirement: Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained soils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.", "Qno": 1446}, "Q1447": {"statement": "Which of the following are the methods of weed control in agriculture?

Unlike ENSO, which is stationary, the MJO is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average. This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from ENSO, which once established, is associated with persistent features that last several seasons or longer over the Pacific Ocean basin. There can be multiple MJO events within a season, and so the MJO is best described as intraseasonal tropical climate variability (i.e. varies on a week-to-week basis). The MJO consists of two parts, or phases: one is the enhanced rainfall (or convective) phase and the other is the suppressed rainfall phase. Strong MJO activity often dissects the planet into halves: one half within the enhanced convective phase and the other half in the suppressed convective phase. These two phases produce opposite changes in clouds and rainfall and this entire dipole (i.e., having two main opposing centers of action) propagates eastward.

(a) Loo (b) Low pressure over Delhi (c) Temperature inversion (d) Monsoon winds", "hint": "Temperature Inversion: Usually as we move up in troposphere from the surface, the temperature decreases with increase in altitude. But sometimes due to local conditions, the temperature, instead of decreasing, increases with height. This phenomenon is called temperature inversion. This is also known as negative lapse rate. This inversion however, disappears with sunrise. The duration and height of surface inversion increases pole wards. Following conditions are required for ground surface inversion: #Long winter nights #Cloudless calm skies #Dry air and low relative humidity #Calm atmosphere or slow movement of air #Snow covered surface 2) Upper air inversion: it occurs when the warm air is transported upwards into the cold air due to eddies. It may be caused due to compression of the descending air as it happens in the case of subtropical high pressure belts. 3) Frontal inversion: it is caused by horizontal and vertical movement of air. The temperate cyclones are formed by convergence of warm westerlies and cold polar air, and thus the warm air overlies the cold air. The presence of warm air above and cold air below reverses the normal lapse rate and inversion of temperature occurs. Social relevance of temperature inversion: The inversion of temperature and its duration affects adversely the society and economy of the region of its occurrence. Some of the important consequences of temperature inversion are- 1) Occurance of fog: there develops clouds in contact with the ground(fog) with visibility usually restricted less than 1km. in the urban areas, the fog mixed with smoke takes the shape of smog. While fog is injurious to crops, the smog is considered as a health hazard. In 1952, about 4000 people died of smog in London. Breathing problems, asthma and bronchitis etc are common problem in Delhi and big cities of the northern india during the winter season. 2) Road accidents: the frequency of road, railways and air accidents increases during foggy conditions due to low visibility. The trains and flights are often delayed. 3) Damage of crops: the winter crops like wheat, barley, mustard, vegetables, chilies, potato etc are seriously damaged. The sugarcane crop in the northern plains of India. Especially in UP, Punjab and Haryana develops the disease of red rod which reduces the sugar content. 4) Vegetation: Orchards are closely influenced by the inversion of temperature.

Bergschrund Bergschrund, (German: “mountain crevice”), a crevasse or series of crevasses often found near the head of a mountain glacier. The erosion of the rock beneath a bergschrund contributes to the formation of a cirque. Stacks: A stack or sea stack is a geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast, formed by wave erosion. Stacks are formed over time by wind and water, processes of coastal geomorphology. They are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action, which is the force of the sea or water crashing against the rock. Yardang A yardang is a streamlined protuberance carved from bedrock or any consolidated or semiconsolidated material by the dual action of wind abrasion by dust and sand, and deflation which is the removal of loose material by wind turbulence. Yardangs become elongated features typically three or more times longer than wide, and when viewed from above, resemble the hull of a boat. Facing the wind is a steep, blunt face that gradually gets lower and narrower toward the lee end. Yardangs are formed by wind erosion, typically of an originally flat surface formed from areas of harder and softer material. The soft material is eroded and removed by the wind, and the harder material remains. The resulting pattern of yardangs is therefore a combination of the original rock distribution, and the fluid mechanics of the air flow and resulting pattern of erosion.

Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking abyssal hills). Statement (2) is a factual statement and it is correct. Karst is a topography formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves. It has also been documented for more weathering-resistant rocks, such as quartzite, given the right conditions. Subterranean drainage may limit surface water, with few to no rivers or lakes. However, in regions where the dissolved bedrock is covered (perhaps by debris) or confined by one or more superimposed non-soluble rock strata, distinctive karst features may occur only at subsurface levels and be totally missing above ground.

Sunspot populations quickly rise and more slowly fall on an irregular cycle of 11 years, although significant variations in the number of sunspots attending the 11-year period are known over longer spans of time. Since sunspots are darker than the surrounding photosphere it might be expected that more sunspots would lead to less solar radiation and a decreased solar constant. However, the surrounding margins of sunspots are brighter than the average, and so are hotter; overall, more sunspots increase the Sun's solar constant or brightness.

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary, a crustal extension or spreading apart of the surface, which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion. When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart, a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks, forming a graben. The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new. That feature is the beginning of the rift valley, but as the process continues, the valley widens, until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area. One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift. Note: Himalayan rivers do not form a rift valley.

The pardoning power of the President is independent of the Judiciary; it is an executive power. But, the President while exercising this power, does not sit as a court of appeal. The object of conferring this power on the President is two-fold: (a) to keep the door open for correcting any judicial errors in the operation of law; and, (b) to afford relief from a sentence, which the President regards as unduly harsh. Under Article 161 of the Constitution, the governor of a state also possesses the pardoning power. But, the pardoning power of the governor differs from that of the President in following two respects: 1. The President can pardon sentences inflicted by court martial (military courts) while the governor cannot. 2. The President can pardon death sentence while governor cannot. Even if a state law prescribes death sentence, the power to grant pardon lies with the President and not the governor. However, the governor can suspend, remit or commute a death sentence. In other words, both the governor and the President have concurrent power in respect of suspension, remission and commutation of death sentence. The Constitution does not provide for any mechanism to question the legality of decisions of President with regard to mercy jurisdiction. But the Supreme Court in Epuru Sudhakar case has given scope for judicial review of the pardon powers of President and Governors for the purpose of ruling out any arbitrariness.

It is the product of the global air circulation cell known as the Hadley Cell. The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds, which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight, and haze during daylight hours as a result of the stable atmosphere found near its location. The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere, creating both the trade winds and the westerlies. The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its most northern latitude in early fall, before moving equatorward during the cold season. The El Niño southern climate oscillation (ENSO) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges. The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low-latitude periphery.

Condensation nuclei are formed from a variety of sources including dust, pollen, smoke, salt from ocean spray and sulfates. • There are two broad categories of condensation nuclei: hygroscopic and hydrophobic. Hygroscopic nuclei are \"water seeking\" nuclei. Water vapor condenses on hygroscopic surfaces readily even when the relative humidity is considerably lower than 70 percent i.e. even when the air is not yet saturated. Whereas Hydrophobic nuclei are water repelling and condensation start only at relative humidities greater than 100 percent, and even then with great difficulty. Examples of hydrophobic nuclei are oil, gasoline, and paraffin wax. • Temperature inversion, a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere, in which a layer of cool air at the surface is overlain by a layer of warmer air. (Under normal conditions air temperature usually decreases with height). Inversions play an important role in determining cloud forms, precipitation, and visibility. An inversion acts as a cap on the upward movement of air from the layers below. As a result, convection produced by the heating of air from below is limited to levels below the inversion. Diffusion of dust, smoke, and other air pollutants is likewise limited. Thus temperature inversion enhances pollution. • Several factors in urban areas may lead to increase precipitation, for ex., the urban heat island creates thermally induced upward motions that act to increase the atmosphere’s instability.", "Qno": 1642}, "Q1643": {"statement": "Consider the following statements: 1.

The reverse process, called “down- welling,” also occurs when wind causes surface water to build up along a coastline and the surface water eventually sinks toward the bottom. Water that rises to the surface as a result of upwelling is typically colder and is rich in nutrients. These nutrients “fertilize” surface waters, meaning that these surface waters often have high biological productivity.

Soil movement by rainfall (raindrop splash) is usually greatest and most noticeable during short-duration, high-intensity thunderstorms. Sheet Erosion Sheet erosion is the movement of soil from raindrop splash and runoff water. It typically occurs evenly over a uniform slope and goes unnoticed until most of the productive topsoil has been lost. Deposition of the eroded soil occurs at the bottom of the slope or in low areas. Rill Erosion Rill erosion results when surface water runoff concentrates, forming small yet well-defined channels.

It lies 75-1000 km (46-621 miles) above the Earth. (The Earth’s radius is 6370 km, so the thickness of the ionosphere is quite tiny compared with the size of Earth.) Because of the high energy from the Sun and from cosmic rays, the atoms in this area have been stripped of one or more of their electrons, or “ionized,” and are therefore positively charged. The ionized electrons behave as free particles. The Sun's upper atmosphere, the corona, is very hot and produces a constant stream of plasma and UV and X-rays that flow out from the Sun and affect, or ionize, the Earth's ionosphere. Only half the Earth’s ionosphere is being ionized by the Sun at any time. During the night, without interference from the Sun, cosmic rays ionize the ionosphere, though not nearly as strongly as the Sun. These high energy rays originate from sources throughout our own galaxy and the universe -- rotating neutron stars, supernovae, radio galaxies, quasars and black holes. Thus the ionosphere is much less charged at nighttime, which is why a lot of ionospheric effects are easier to spot at night – it takes a smaller change to notice them. The ionosphere has major importance to us because, among other functions, it influences radio propagation to distant places on the Earth, and between satellites and Earth. For the very low frequency (VLF) waves that the space weather monitors track, the ionosphere and the ground produce a “waveguide” through which radio signals can bounce and make their way around the curved Earth: The Earth’s ionosphere and ground form a “waveguide” through which VLF radio signals can propagate or “bounce” around the Earth.The Earth’s ionosphere and ground form a “waveguide” through which VLF radio signals can propagate or “bounce” around the Earth.

One of the reasons that the Drain theory is attributed to Naoroji is his decision to estimate the net national profit of India, and by extension, the effect that colonisation has on the country. Through his work with economics, Naoroji sought to prove that Britannia was draining money out of India. Naoroji described 6 factors which resulted in the external drain. Firstly, India is governed by a foreign government. Secondly, India does not attract immigrants which bring labour and capital for economic growth. Thirdly, India pays for Britain's civil administrations and occupational army. Fourthly, India bears the burden of empire building in and out of its borders. Fifthly, opening the country to free trade was actually a way to exploit India by offering highly paid jobs to foreign personnel. Lastly, the principal income-earners would buy outside of India or leave with the money as they were mostly foreign personnel. In Naoroji's book 'Poverty' he estimated a 200–300 million pounds loss of India's revenue to Britain that is not returned.

The truce period, it was argued, would enable the masses to recoup their strength to fight and also give the Government a chance to respond to the demands of the nationalists. The masses could not go on sacrificing indefinitely. If the Government did not respond positively, the movement could be resumed again with the participation of the masses. This was the Struggle-Truce-Struggle or S-T-S strategy. Criticizing the S-T-S strategy, Nehru argued that the Indian national movement had reached a stage, after the Lahore Congress call for purna swaraj programme, in which there should, be a continuous confrontation and conflict with imperialism till it was overthrown. He advocated maintenance of a \"continuous direct action\" policy by the Congress and without the interposition of a constitutionalist phase. Real power, he said, cannot be won by two annas and four annas. Against a S-T-S strategy, he suggested a Struggle-Victory (S-V) strategy. The \"carrot and stick\" approach (also \"carrot or stick approach\") is an idiom that refers to a policy of offering a combination of reward and punishment to induce good behavior. It is named in reference to a cart driver dangling a carrot in front of a mule and holding a stick behind it. The mule would move towards the carrot because it wants the reward of food, while also moving away from the stick behind it, since it does not want the punishment of pain, thus drawing the cart.

    "hint": "a is correct: The First Amendment Act, 1951, added the fourth clause to Article 15 that empowered the government to make any law for the upliftment of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It reads, “Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.” \n\nThe added clause elucidates that in case such special provisions are introduced, they cannot be said to be breaching Article 15 and Article 29(2) of the Constitution.\n\nThe need to insert this clause was felt after the decision of the Supreme Court in the State of Madras v. Srimathi Champakam (1951). According to the facts of this case, the Madras government issued an Order that provided reservation on the grounds of religion, race, and caste. This Order was contended to be in breach of Article 15(1) of the Indian Constitution. \n\nThe Court also gave a literal interpretation to the constitutional provisions and held that reserving seats in public institutions for backward classes violates Articles 15(1) and 29(2). Therefore, in order to nullify the effect of similar judicial pronouncements, Article 15 was amended.\n\nSimilarly, Article 19(1)(a) grants the right to free speech and expression to Indian citizens. This right is considered an essential feature of democracy. However, Article 19(2) specifies the restrictions that can\ncurtail this freedom. The First Amendment to the Indian Constitution altered these restrictions by widening their ambit. The second change, via the Amendment Act of 1951, was made to Clause 6 of\nArticle 19.\n\nNeed of amendment of Article 19(2)\nWhen the Constitution was adopted, the barriers to free speech and expression included ‘security of state’, ‘decency or morality’, ‘contempt of Court’, and ‘defamation’. With the First Amendment, the\nfollowing three restrictions were added to Clause 2 of Article 19:\n• Friendly relations with foreign states- This was added to prohibit any kind of malicious propaganda\nagainst a foreign nation. This addition was an attempt to build friendly relations with foreign states.\n•Public Order- This barrier was constructed in response to the case of Romesh Thappar v. The State of Madras (1950). The Supreme Court observed that the ambit of Article 19(1) was so large that it can\neven acquit a person charged with the offence of murder. Also, the Court stated that the expression\n‘security of state’ is not comprehensive enough to include the concept of ‘public order’. This decision\nwas sufficient to introduce an amendment to Article 19(2).\nIn the case of Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra and Others (1961), the Supreme Court examined\nthe ambit of restriction ‘public order’. In this case, Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1908\nwas upheld on the ground that it was a reasonable restriction to prevent a person from carrying out\ncertain acts if those acts were likely to disturb public tranquillity or result in a riot or an affray.\n• Incitement to an offence- This is a limitation on free speech in the form of opinions or agitations\non the involvement of an accused in any crime.\nNeed for amendment of Article 19(6)\nThe alteration was made in Article 19(6) via the First Amendment, and the intention behind this was to\navoid objections to the power of the state to create any monopoly.\n\nArticle 19(6) is a reasonable restriction on the right to practice any profession or to carry on any\noccupation, trade, or business. Before the First Amendment, the State had the power to impose\nreasonable restrictions by asserting that it is in the interests of the general public. This conferred the\nstate the power to implement any scheme of nationalisation provided it is ‘reasonable’. However, the\nAmendment in 1951 added the clause which said, “the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned\nor controlled by the State, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete\nor partial, of citizens or otherwise”, thus removing any scope of ambiguity regarding the power of the\ngovernment to nationalise. This modification even excluded the factor of reasonableness while creating\nsuch a monopoly.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Saghir Ahmad v. the State of U.P. and Others. (1954) studied the\nconsequences of this amendment. The Court observed that after this alteration, the government can\ncreate a monopoly in its own favour, but this clause will prevent it from creating any monopoly in the\nfavour of third parties.\nSource: https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/first-amendment-to-constitutionchallenged-supreme-court-8252509/\nhttps://blog.ipleaders.in/first-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\nSubject) Polity/IR",

It is estimated to have approximately 3.4 million metric tons of cobalt reserves, which is the largest in the world. \n\nThis abundance of cobalt resources has made the DRC a significant player in the global cobalt market.\n\n2) Artisanal Mining: A significant portion of cobalt production in the DRC comes from artisanal and small-scale mining operations. These operations involve individual miners or small groups extracting cobalt using basic tools and equipment. \n\nHowever, due to the informal nature of this mining sector, it can be associated with challenges such as poor working conditions, environmental concerns, and potential human rights issues.\n\n\n3) Industrial Mining Operations: Alongside artisanal mining, the DRC also has large-scale industrial mining operations run by multinational mining companies. \n\nThese operations use modern machinery and technologies to extract cobalt from mines.

    "hint": " \nOrdinary Bills \nEvery ordinary bill has to pass through the following five stages in the Parliament before it \nfinds a place on the Statute Book: \n1. First Reading  \nAn ordinary bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament. Such a bill can be \nintroduced either by a minister or by any other member. The member who wants to \nintroduce the bill has to ask for the leave of the House. When the House grants leave to \nintroduce the bill, the mover of the bill introduces it by reading its title and objectives. No \ndiscussion on the bill takes place at this stage. Later, the bill is published in the Gazette of \nIndia. If a bill is published in the Gazette before its introduction, leave of the House to \nintroduce the bill is not necessary.18 The introduction of the bill and its publication in the \nGazette constitute the first reading of the bill. \n2. Second Reading  \nDuring this stage, the bill receives not only the general but also the detailed scrutiny and \nassumes its final shape. Hence, it forms the most important stage in the enactment of a bill. \nIn fact, this stage involves three more sub-stages, namely, stage of general discussion, \ncommittee stage and consideration stage. \n(a) Stage of General Discussion: The printed copies of the bill are distributed to all the \nmembers. The principles of the bill and its provisions are discussed generally, but the details \nof the bill are not discussed. \nAt this stage, the House can take any one of the following four actions: \n(i) It may take the bill into consideration immediately or on some other fixed date; \n(ii) It may refer the bill to a select committee of the House; \n(iii) It may refer the bill to a joint committee of the two Houses; and \n(iv) It may circulate the bill to elicit public opinion. \nA Select Committee consists of members of the House where the bill has originated and a \njoint committee consists of members of both the Houses of Parliament. \n(b) Committee Stage: The usual practice is to refer the bill to a select committee of the \nHouse. This committee examines the bill thoroughly and in detail, clause by clause. It can \n\n\nalso amend its provisions, but without altering the principles underlying it. After completing \nthe scrutiny and discussion, the committee reports the bill back to the House. \n(c) Consideration Stage: The House, after receiving the bill from the select committee, \nconsiders the provisions of the bill clause by clause. Each clause is discussed and voted upon \nseparately. The members can also move amendments and if accepted, they become part of \nthe bill. \n3. Third Reading  \nAt this stage, the debate is confined to the acceptance or rejection of the bill as a whole and \nno amendments are allowed, as the general principles underlying the bill have already been \nscrutinised during the stage of second reading. If the majority of members present and \nvoting accept the bill, the bill is regarded as passed by the House. Thereafter, the bill is \nauthenticated by the presiding officer of the House and transmitted to the second House for \nconsideration and approval. A bill is deemed to have been passed by the Parliament only \nwhen both the Houses have agreed to it, either with or without amendments.",

    "hint": "There are at least three situations where the President can exercise the powers using his or her own discretion. \n* The President can send back the advice given by the Council of Ministers and ask the Council to \nreconsider the decision. In doing this, the President acts on his (or her) own discretion. \n* The President also has veto power by which he can withhold or refuse to give assent to Bills (other than \nMoney Bill) passed by the Parliament. Every bill passed by the Parliament goes to the President for his \nassent before it becomes a law. The President can send the bill back to the Parliament asking it to \nreconsider the bill. This „veto‟ power is limited because, if the Parliament passes the same bill again and \nsends it back to the President, then, the President has to give assent to that bill. However, there is no                                                         mention in the Constitution about the time limit within which the President must send the bill back for \nreconsideration. This means that the President can just keep the bill pending with him without any time \nlimit. This gives the President an informal power to use the veto in a very effective manner. This is \nsometimes referred to as „pocket veto‟. \n* The third kind of discretion arises more out of political circumstances. Formally, the President appoints \nthe Prime Minister. Normally, in the parliamentary system, a leader who has the support of the \nmajority in the LokSabha would be appointed as Prime Minister and the question of discretion \nwould not arise. But imagine a situation when after an election, no leader has a clear majority in the \nLokSabha. Imagine further that after attempts to forge alliances, two or three leaders are claiming that \nthey have the support of the majority in the house. Now, the President has to decide whom to appoint as \nthe Prime Minister. In such a situation, the President has to use his own discretion in judging who really \nmay have the support of the majority or who can actually form and run the government. \nAppointment of Chief Justice of India is not a discretionary power of the President.",

    "hint": " \nThe Constitution of J&K was adopted on 17 November 1957, and came into force on 26 \nJanuary 1957.  \nIts salient features (as amended from time to time) are as follows: \n1. It declares the State of J&K to be an integral part of India. \n2. It secures justice, liberty, equality and fraternity to the people of the state. \n3. It says that the State of J&K comprises all the territory that was under the ruler of the \nstate on 15 August 1947. This means that the territory of the state also includes the area \nwhich is under the occupation of Pakistan. \n4. It lays down that a citizen of India is treated as a ‘permanent resident’ of the state if on 14 \nMay 1954 (a) he was a state subject of Class I or Class II, or (b) having lawfully acquired \nimmovable property in the state, he has been ordinarily resident in the state for 10 years \nprior to that date, or (c) any person who before 14 May, 1954 was a state subject of Class I \nor Class II and who, having migrated to Pakistan after 1 March 1947, returns to the state for \nresettlement. \n5. It clarifies that the permanent residents of the state are entitled to all rights guaranteed \nunder the Constitution of India. But, any change in the definition of ‘permanent’ can be \nmade by the state legislature only. \n6. It contains a list of directive principles that are to be treated as fundamental in the \ngovernance of the state. However, they are not judicially enforceable. \n7. It provides for a bicameral legislature consisting of the legislative assembly and the \nlegislative council. The assembly consists of 111 members directly elected by the people. \nOut of this, 24 seats are to remain vacant as they are allotted for the area that is under the \noccupation of Pakistan. Hence, as an interim measure, the total strength of the Assembly is \nto be taken as 87 for all practical purposes. The council consists of 36 members, most of \nthem are elected in an indirect manner and some of them are nominated by the Governor, \nwho is also an integral part of the state legislature. \n8. It vests the executive powers of the state in the governor appointed by the president for a \nterm of five years. It provides for a council of ministers headed by the chief minister to aid \nand advise the governor in the exercise of his functions. The council of ministers is \ncollectively responsible to the assembly. Under the original Constitution of J&K (1957), the \nhead of the state and head of the government were designated as Sadar-i-Riyasat \n(President) and Waziri- Azam (Prime Minister) respectively. In 1965, they were redesig-\nnated as governor and chief Minister respectively. Also, the head of the state was to be \nelected by the state assembly. \n9. It establishes a high court consisting of a chief justice and two or more other judges. They \nare appointed by the president in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the \nGovernor of the state. The High Court of J&K is a court of record and enjoys original, \nappellate and writ jurisdictions. However, it can issue writs only for the enforcement of \nfundamental rights and not for any other purpose. \n10. It provides for Governor’s Rule. Hence, the governor, with the concurrence of the \nPresident of India, can assume to himself all the powers of the state government, except \nthose of the high court. He can dissolve the assembly and dismiss the council of ministers. \nThe Governor’s Rule can be imposed when the state administration cannot be carried on in \naccordance with the provisions of the J&K Constitution. It was imposed for the first time in \n1977. Notably, in 1964, Article 356 of the Indian Constitution (dealing with the imposition of \nPresident’s Rule in a state) was extended to the state of J&K. \n11. It declares Urdu as the official language of the state. It also permits the use of English for \nofficial purposes unless the state legislature provides otherwise. \n12. It lays down the procedure for its amendment. It can be amended by a bill passed in \neach house of the state legislature by a majority of two-thirds of the total membership of \nthat house. Such a bill must be introduced in the assembly only. However, no bill of \nconstitutional amendment can be moved in either House if it seeks to change the \nrelationship of the state with the Union of India.",

It refers to the responsiveness of tax revenue growth to \nchanges in GDP. When a tax is buoyant, its revenue increases without increasing the tax \nrate. \nHow tax buoyancy works? \n A simple example in the context of our economy indicates the power of this concept. In \n2007-08, everything was fine for the economy. GDP growth rate was nearly 9 per cent. \n Tax revenue of the government, especially, that of direct taxes registered a growth rate of \n45 per cent in 2007-08.

Tax revenue growth also fell steeply; to 18 per cent. This means tax \nbuoyancy was 3 for the year. We can imagine that had the GDP growth came down further \nin the next year, to say 4 per cent, tax revenue growth would have fell to 8 per cent; \nindicating a tax buoyancy of 2. \nTax elasticity \n A similar looking concept is tax elasticity.

Deflation. \n \nBoom \nDuring a boom, the economy is growing and output is high. Consumer spending is also at a \nhigh, with many willing to borrow money in order to fund their purchases. High mortgage \nlending by banks and building societies helps the growing figure of house prices. \nUnemployment is likely to be at a low, so much so businesses may find it difficult to recruit \nnew employees. There will be a strong demand for goods and services and, combined with \n\nan increase in wages (as businesses compete to employ a limited supply of workers) \ninflation may increase. Businesses may not be able to cope with the increased demand, \ninstead demand is likely to shift towards imported goods. Encouraged by the strong \ndemand, businesses tend to increase their investment spending in order to maximise their \ncapacity. The number of new businesses created will be at record numbers, having been \nattracted by the possibility of high profits. \nRecession \nIf GDP is growing at a very low rate, the terms ‘recession’ or ‘downturn’ are usually applied. \nDuring this time the rate of economic growth begins to fall. Due to the decrease in growth, \nunemployment levels rise, this leads onto even lower demand growth. Businesses will find it \nincreasingly difficult to push through price increases, causing the rate of inflation to fall. \nMany businesses will see a fall off in the growth of sales; profit growth will also falter and \nmay even become negative. The demand for imported goods will fall as the rate of growth \nin overall spending by UK customers slows. \nSlump/Depression \nIf economic growth becomes negative then it’s referred to either as a ‘slump’ or \n‘depression’. During a slump unemployment is relatively high and inflation is low. Falls in \ndemand will often lead to workers being laid off. It will become difficult for businesses to \nincrease their prices without sacrificing sales. Investment by business will be low, and there \nwill be spare capacity in the economy. \nRecovery \nDuring recovery the economy starts to pick up, the rate of GDP increases, moving from a \nnegative position to a positive one. Unemployment, too, begins to fall as businesses are able \nto take on more workers in order to cope with the rise in economic activity. Inflation may \nincrease alongside the rate of growth demand, and businesses will begin to increase their \ninvestment spending as business confidence increases.",

    "hint": "A national income estimate measures the volume of commodities and services turned out \nduring a given period, counted without duplication. Thus, a total of national income \nmeasures the flow of goods and services in an economy. National Income is a flow and not a \nstock. As contrasted with national wealth which measures the stock of commodities held by \nthe nationals of a country at a point of time, national income measures the productive \npower of an economy in a given period to turn out goods and services for the satisfaction of \nhuman wants. Hence, statement (a) is incorrect. \nThere are various concepts of National Income. The main concepts of NI are: GDP, GNP, \nNNP, NI, PI, DI, and PCI. These different concepts explain about the phenomenon of \neconomic activities of the various sectors of the various sectors of the economy. \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) \nThe most important concept of national income is Gross Domestic Product. Gross domestic \nproduct is the money value of all final goods and services produced within the domestic \nterritory of a country during a year. \nGross National Product (GNP) \nGross National Product is the total market value of all final goods and services produced \nannually in a country plus net factor income from abroad. Thus, GNP is the total measure of \nthe flow of goods and services at market value resulting from current production during a \nyear in a country including net factor income from abroad. \nPersonal Income (PI) \nPersonal Income is the total money income received by individuals and households of a \ncountry from all possible sources before direct taxes. \nPI = NI - Corporate Income Taxes - Undistributed Corporate Profits - Social Security \nContribution + Transfer Payments \n \nDisposable Income (DI) \n\nThe income left after the payment of direct taxes from personal income is called Disposable \nIncome. Disposable income means actual income which can be spent on consumption by \nindividuals and families. Thus, it can be expressed as:  \nDI = PI - Direct Taxes \nFrom consumption approach,  \nDI=Consumption Expenditure + Savings \n \nPer Capita Income (PCI) \nPer Capita Income of a country is derived by dividing the national income of the country by \nthe total population of a country. Thus,  \nPCI = Total National Income/Total National Population",

    "hint": "All the given pairs are correct. \nGender Inequality Index (GII) by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) \n\nThe GII is an inequality index. It measures gender inequalities in three important aspects of \nhuman development—reproductive health, measured by maternal mortality ratio and \nadolescent birth rates; empowerment, measured by proportion of parliamentary seats \noccupied by females and proportion of adult females and males aged 25 years and older \nwith at least some secondary education; and economic status, expressed as labour market \nparticipation and measured by labour force participation rate of female and male \npopulations aged 15 years and older. The GII is built on the same framework as the IHDI—to \nbetter expose differences in the distribution of achievements between women and men. It \nmeasures the human development costs of gender inequality. Thus the higher the GII value \nthe more disparities between females and males and the more loss to human development. \nWorld Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index \nAccording to the 2017 World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index, India fell 21 \nplaces to 108 – far below the global average and much behind its neighbours China and \nBangladesh. India lost out mainly because of lower participation of women in the economy \nand low wages. \nThe Global Gender Gap measure was introduced by the World Economic Forum to examine \nfour critical areas of inequality between men and women:  \n Economic participation and opportunity – outcomes on salaries, participation levels \nand access to high-skilled employment \n Educational attainment – outcomes on access to basic and higher level education \n Political empowerment – outcomes on representation in decision-making structures \n Health and survival – outcomes on life expectancy and sex ratio \nThe Gender Gap Index assesses countries on how well they are dividing their resources and \nopportunities among their male and female populations, regardless of the overall levels of \nthese resources and opportunities. By providing a comprehensible framework for assessing \nand comparing global gender gaps and by revealing those countries that are role models in \ndividing these resources equitably between women and men, serves as a catalyst for greater \nawareness as well as greater exchange between policymakers. \nThe Global Gender Gap Report ranks 144 countries on the progress they have made towards \ngender parity in four areas – health, education, economics and politics. \nOECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) \nThe Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a new composite measure of gender \nequality, based on the OECD’s Gender, Institutions and Development Database.

    "hint": "The marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) refers to the minimum interest rate \nof a bank below which it cannot lend, except in some cases allowed by the RBI. It is an internal \nbenchmark or reference rate for the bank. MCLR actually describes the method by which the \nminimum interest rate for loans is determined by a bank - on the basis of marginal cost or the \nadditional or incremental cost of arranging one more rupee to the prospective borrower. \nThe MCLR methodology for fixing interest rates for advances was introduced by the Reserve \nBank of India with effect from April 1, 2016. This new methodology replaces the base rate \nsystem introduced in July 2010. In other words, all rupee loans sanctioned and credit limits \nrenewed w.e.f. April 1, 2016 would be priced with reference to the Marginal Cost of Funds \nbased Lending Rate (MCLR) which will be the internal benchmark (means a reference rate \ndetermined internally by the bank) for such purposes. \nExisting loans and credit limits linked to the Base Rate (internal benchmark rate used to \ndetermine interest rates up till 31 March 2016) or Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR or the \ninternal benchmark rate used to determine the interest rates on advances/loans sanctioned upto \nJune 30, 2010.) would continue till repayment or renewal, as the case may be. However, \nexisting borrowers will have the option to move to the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending \nRate (MCLR) linked loan at mutually acceptable terms. \nReasons for introducing MCLR \nRBI decided to shift from base rate to MCLR because the rates based on marginal cost of funds \nare more sensitive to changes in the policy rates. This is very essential for the effective \nimplementation of monetary policy. Prior to MCLR system, different banks were following \ndifferent methodology for calculation of base rate /minimum rate – that is either on the basis of \naverage cost of funds or marginal cost of funds or blended cost of funds. Thus, MCLR aims \n To improve the transmission of policy rates into the lending rates of banks. \n To bring transparency in the methodology followed by banks for determining interest rates \non advances. \n To ensure availability of bank credit at interest rates which are fair to borrowers as well as \nbanks. \n To enable banks to become more competitive and enhance their long run value and \ncontribution to economic growth.",

Now, the money held by the RBI does \nnot form part of the banking system. So, if the RBI releases rupees from its coffers to buy dollars, the \nmoney supply in the banking system increases. That can be a problem. \nMore money in the banking system means higher bond prices. Because banks will have more money, \nthey will buy more bonds. \nAnd that will push up bond prices. Since bonds carry an inverse price-yield relationship, higher bond \nprices means lower yields. The problem is that lower yields will force the RBI to cut interest rates \nfurther. \nIf the RBI does not want to cut rates, it will reduce (sterilise) liquidity that causes the yields to fall. It will \ndo so by selling the government bonds that it holds in its books.

    "hint": "J Curve \nIn economics, the 'J curve' is the time path of a country’s trade balance following a \ndevaluation or depreciation of its currency, under a certain set of assumptions. A devalued \ncurrency means imports are more expensive, and on the assumption that the volumes of \nimports and exports change little at first, this causes a fall in the current account (a bigger \ndeficit or smaller surplus). After some time, though, the volume of exports may start to rise \nbecause of their lower and hence more competitive prices to foreign buyers, and domestic \nconsumers may buy fewer of the costlier imports. Eventually, if this happens, the trade \nbalance should move to a smaller deficit or larger surplus compared to what it was before \nthe devaluation. Likewise, if there is a currency revaluation or appreciation the same \nreasoning may be applied and will lead to an inverted J curve. \n \n \nImmediately following the depreciation or devaluation of the currency, the total value of \nimports will increase and exports remain largely unchanged due in part to pre-existing trade \ncontracts that have to be honored. This is because in the short run, prices of imports rise \ndue to the depreciation and also in the short run there is a lag in changing consumption of \nimports, therefore there is an immediate jump followed by a lag until the long run prevails \nand consumers stop importing as many expensive goods and along with the rise in exports \ncause the current account to increase (a smaller defect or a bigger surplus). Moreover, in \nthe short run, demand for the more expensive imports (and demand for exports, which are \ncheaper to foreign buyers using foreign currencies) remain price inelastic. This is due to time \nlags in the consumer's search for acceptable, cheaper alternatives (which might not exist). \nOver the longer term a depreciation in the exchange rate can have the desired effect of \nimproving the current account balance. Domestic consumers might switch their expenditure \nto domestic products and away from expensive imported goods and services, assuming \nequivalent domestic alternatives exist. Equally, many foreign consumers may switch to \npurchasing the products being exported into their country, which are now cheaper in the \nforeign currency, instead of their own domestically produced goods and services.",

    "hint": "Instruments of Monetary Policy \nThere are several direct and indirect instruments that are used for implementing monetary \npolicy. \n Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank provides overnight \nliquidity to banks against the collateral of government and other approved securities \nunder the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).  \n Reverse Repo Rate: The (fixed) interest rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs \nliquidity, on an overnight basis, from banks against the collateral of eligible \ngovernment securities under the LAF.  \n Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): The LAF consists of overnight as well as term \nrepo auctions. Progressively, the Reserve Bank has increased the proportion of \nliquidity injected under fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of range of tenors. \nThe aim of term repo is to help develop the inter-bank term money market, which in \nturn can set market based benchmarks for pricing of loans and deposits, and hence \nimprove transmission of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank also conducts variable \ninterest rate reverse repo auctions, as necessitated under the market conditions.  \n Marginal Standing Facility (MSF): A facility under which scheduled commercial \nbanks can borrow additional amount of overnight money from the Reserve Bank by \ndipping into their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal rate \nof interest. This provides a safety valve against unanticipated liquidity shocks to the \nbanking system.  \n Corridor: The MSF rate and reverse repo rate determine the corridor for the daily \nmovement in the weighted average call money rate.  \n Bank Rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy or rediscount bills \nof exchange or other commercial papers. The Bank Rate is published under Section \n49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This rate has been aligned to the MSF rate \nand, therefore, changes automatically as and when the MSF rate changes alongside \npolicy repo rate changes. \n Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The average daily balance that a bank is required to \nmaintain with the Reserve Bank as a share of such per cent of its Net demand and \n\ntime liabilities (NDTL) that the Reserve Bank may notify from time to time in the \nGazette of India.  \n Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of NDTL that a bank is required to \nmaintain in safe and liquid assets, such as, unencumbered government securities, \ncash and gold. Changes in SLR often influence the availability of resources in the \nbanking system for lending to the private sector.  \n Open Market Operations (OMOs): These include both, outright purchase and sale of \ngovernment securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity, respectively.  \n Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary management was \nintroduced in 2004. Surplus liquidity of a more enduring nature arising from large \ncapital inflows is absorbed through sale of short-dated government securities and \ntreasury bills.

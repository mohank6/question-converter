This is carried out through investments – in \nthe form of loans, grants and information sharing – in infrastructure, health care services, \nfinancial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of \nclimate change or better manage their natural resources, as well as other areas. \nEighty percent of ADB’s lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational \nareas. \n Education – Most developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have earned high \nmarks for a dramatic rise in primary education enrollment rates in the last three \ndecades, but daunting challenges remain, threatening economic and social growth. \n Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management – Environmental \nsustainability is a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia \nand the Pacific. \n Finance Sector Development – The financial system is the lifeline of a country’s \neconomy. It creates prosperity that can be shared throughout society and benefit \nthe poorest and most vulnerable people. Financial sector and capital market \ndevelopment, including microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and \nregulatory reforms, is vital to decreasing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. This has \nbeen a key priority of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) since 2002. \nOne of the most active sub-sectors of finance is the PSOD's support for trade \nfinance. Each year the PSOD finances billions of dollars in letters of credit across all \nof Asia and the rest of the world. \n Infrastructure, including transport and communications, energy, water supply and \nsanitation, and urban development. \n Regional Cooperation and Integration – Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) \nwas introduced by President Kuroda when he joined the ADB in 2004. It was seen as \na long-standing priority of the Japanese government as a process by which national \neconomies become more regionally connected. It plays a critical role in accelerating \neconomic growth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and \nemployment, and strengthening institutions. \n Private Sector Lending – This priority was introduced into the ADB's activities at the \ninsistence of the Reagan Administration. However, that effort was never a true \n\npriority until the administration of President Tadeo Chino who in turn brought in a \nseasoned American banker – Robert Bestani. From then on, the Private Sector \nOperations Department (PSOD) grew at a very rapid pace, growing from the smallest \nfinancing unit of the ADB to the largest in terms of financing volume.

The \nqualitative or selective methods of credit control are adopted by the Central Bank in its pursuit of \neconomic stabilisation and as part of credit management.  \n(i) Margin Requirements: The commercial banks generally advance loans to their \ncustomers against some security or securities offered by the borrower and acceptable to \nbanks. Generally, the commercial banks do not lend up to the full amount of the security \nbut lend an amount less than its value. Margin requirement is the minimum amount of \nmoney that a client must have on deposit, either in cash or approved securities, to access \na loan. The margin requirements against specific securities are determined by the Central \nBank. A change in margin requirements will influence the flow of credit. A rise in the \nmargin requirement results in a contraction in the borrowing value of the security and \nsimilarly, a fall in the margin requirement results in expansion in the borrowing value of the \nsecurity. \n(ii) Credit Rationing: Rationing of credit is a method by which the Central Bank seeks to limit \nthe maximum amount of loans and advances and, also in certain cases, fix ceiling for \nspecific categories of loans and advances.  \n(iii) Regulation of Consumer Credit: Regulation of consumer credit is designed to check the \nflow of credit for consumer durable goods. This can be done by regulating the total volume \nof credit that may be extended for purchasing specific durable goods and regulating the \nnumber of instalments through which such loan can be spread.

It could have been eliminated.  \n\nPeriglacial Landform  \nPeriglaciation (adjective: \"periglacial,\" also referring to places at the edges of glacial areas) describes geomorphic processes that result from seasonal thawing of snow in areas of permafrost, the runoff from which refreezes in ice wedges and other structures. \n\n\"Periglacial\" suggests an environment located on the margin of past glaciers. However, freeze and thaw cycles influence landscapes outside areas of past glaciation. Therefore, periglacial environments are anywhere that freezing and thawing modify the landscape in a significant manner. \n\nPeriglaciation results in a variety of ground conditions but especially those involving \nirregular, mixed deposits created by ice wedges, solifluction, gelifluction, frost creep and rockfalls.

Head deposits are more common below outcrops of granite on Dartmoor. \n\n#Patterned Ground – Patterned ground occurs where stones form circles, polygons and stripes.

A process called frost heaving is responsible for these features. \n#Solifluction lobes – Solifluction lobes are formed when waterlogged soil slips down a \n\nslope due to gravity forming U shaped lobes. \n#Blockfields or Felsenmeer – Blockfields are areas covered by large angular blocks, traditionally believed to have been created by freeze-thaw action. \n\nA good example of a blockfield can be found in the Snowdonia National Park, Wales.

The farmer owns a small piece of land, \ngrows crops with the help of his family members and consumes almost the entire farm \nproduce with little surplus to sell in the market.  \n\nPressure of population on agriculture: \nThe population in India is increasing at a rapid pace and exerts heavy pressure on \nagriculture. Agriculture has to provide employment to a large section of work force and has \nto feed the teeming millions.  \n\nImportance of animals: \nAnimal force has always played a significant role in agricultural operations such as \nploughing, irrigation, threshing and transporting the agricultural products. Complete \nmechanisation of Indian agriculture is still a distant goal and animals will continue to \ndominate the agricultural scene in India for several years to come.  \n\nDependent upon Monsoon: \nIndian agriculture is mainly dependent upon monsoon which is uncertain, unreliable and \nirregular. In spite of the large scale expansion of irrigation facilities since Independence, only \none-third of the cropped area is provided by perennial irrigation and the remaining two-\nthird of the cropped area has to bear the brunt of the vagaries of the monsoons.  \n\nPredominance of food crops: \nSince Indian agriculture has to feed a large population, production of food crops is the first \npriority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country. More than two-thirds of the total \ncropped area is devoted to the cultivation of food crops.  \n\nInsignificant place to given fodder crops: \nAlthough India has the largest population of livestock in the world, fodder crops are given a \nvery insignificant place in our cropping pattern. Only four per cent of the reporting area is \ndevoted to permanent pastures and other grazing lands. This is due to pressing demand of \nland for food crops. The result is that the domestic animals are not properly fed and their \nproductivity is very low compared to international standards.  \n\nSeasonal pattern: \nIndia has three major crop seasons.  \n(i) Kharif season starts with the onset of monsoons and continues till the beginning of \nwinter. Major crops of this season are rice, maize, jowar, bajra, cotton, sesamum, groundnut \nand pulses such as moong, urad, etc.  \n(ii) Rabi season starts at the beginning of winter and continues till the end of winter or \nbeginning of summer. Major crops of this season are wheat, barley, jowar, gram and oil \nseeds such as linseed, rape and mustard.  \n(iii) Zaid is summer cropping season in which crops like rice, maize, groundnut, vegetables \nand fruits are grown. Now some varieties of pulses have been evolved which can be \nsuccessfully grown in summer. \nSmall Landholdings \nMore than 80% of India’s farmers are small and marginalized with less than 1 hectare of \nland.  \n\nNote: Gross area under agriculture in India is one of the highest in India in terms of \npercentage. More than 50% of India’s area is under agriculture.   ",

Such maps are called large scale because the representative fraction is relatively \nlarge. For instance a town plan, which is a large scale map, might be on a scale of 1:10,000, \nwhereas the world map, which is a small scale map, might be on a scale of 1:100,000,000. \nThe following table describes typical ranges for these scales but should not be considered \nauthoritative because there is no standard: \nClassification  Range  Examples \nlarge scale  1:0 – 1:600,000  1:0.00001 for map of virus; 1:5,000 for walking map of \ntown \nmedium scale  1:600,000 – 1:2,000,000  Map of a country \nsmall scale  1:2,000,000 – 1:∞  1:50,000,000 for world map; 1:1021 for map of galaxy \n\nThe terms are sometimes used in the absolute sense of the table, but other times in a \nrelative sense.

Since plantations usually grow one type of crop, pest attacks can cause \ntotal destruction of the plantations. Pesticides are therefore used in huge quantities to \nprevent crops from being entirely destroyed by pests. \nLabour: Due to the large size of a plantation, a lot of labour is needed to tend to the crops \nand work in the nearby processing factories. For example in Malaysia’s large rubber \nplantations, many workers are hired to tap latex from rubber trees. \nPRODUCE: \n#The total output of a plantation is usually high. However, as a plantation covers a \nwide area of land, its output per unit is usually low. \n#Usually, only one type p crop is grown in a plantation.

Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is \nconstrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new \ntechnologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or \nachieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by \ndeath rates. \n\n#In stage two, that of a developing country, the death rates drop quickly due to \nimprovements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and \nreduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective \nbreeding and crop rotation and farming techniques. Other improvements generally \ninclude access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous \nimprovements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality. Prior \n to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily in the \nareas of food handling, water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene. One of the \nvariables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health \neducation programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In \nEurope, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern \nEurope and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years. \nWithout a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an imbalance, and the \ncountries in this stage experience a large increase in population. \n\n#In stage three, birth rates fall due to various fertility factors such as access to \ncontraception, increases in wages, urbanization, a reduction in subsistence \nagriculture, an increase in the status and education of women, a reduction in the \nvalue of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of \nchildren and other social changes. Population growth begins to level off. The birth \nrate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern \nEurope. While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, it \nshould be noted that contraceptives were not generally available or widely used in \nthe 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline \nthen. It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in \nvalues; not just because of the availability of contraceptives.  \n\n#During stage four there are both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may \ndrop to well below replacement level as has happened in countries like Germany, \nItaly, and Japan, leading to a shrinking population, a threat to many industries that \nrely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates \nan economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain \nconsistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low \nexercise levels and high obesity and an aging population in developed countries. By \nthe late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off \nat lower rates. \n#Some scholars break out, from stage four, a \"stage five\" of below-replacement \nfertility levels. Others hypothesize a different \"stage five\" involving an increase in \nfertility. \n \nAs with all models, this is an idealized picture of population change in these countries. The \nmodel is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately \ndescribe all individual cases. The extent to which it applies to less-developed societies today \nremains to be seen. Many countries such as China, Brazil and Thailand have passed through \nthe Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic \nchange. Some countries, particularly African countries, appear to be stalled in the second \nstage due to stagnant development and the effect of AIDS.\n \n \n",

Meridional flow is a general air flow pattern from \nnorth to south, or from south to north, along the Earth's longitude lines (perpendicular to a zonal \nflow). Three cell model of meridional circulation of the atmosphere, where is it is believed that \nthere is cellular circulator of the air at each meridian (latitude). Thus, each meridian has three \ncells of air circulation in the northern hemisphere i.e. 1.  Tropical cell or Hadley cell, 2.  Polar \nfront cell or mid-latitude cell or Ferrel cell, and 3.  Polar or subpolar cell.  \n• Horse latitudes represent the dry section of Hadley Cell, here the air descends and hence \nclouds are not formed.",

The growth rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of −13 °C (9 °F). \n\n• Sleet: Sleet is rain or melted snow that freezes into ice pellets before hitting the ground. Sleet occurs during winter weather and is a type of winter precipitation. \n\nAll precipitation falls out of a cloud as snow. In certain instances, in the winter, the snowflake will go through a warmer layer and begin to melt. \n\nAs it continues to fall, it will then proceed through a colder layer and freeze into an ice pellet or ball, very similar to hail. Unlike hail, the pellet only \"falls\" once and is generally very tiny in size. \n\n• Snow: Snow is formed when temperatures are low and there is moisture in the atmosphere in the form of tiny ice crystals. \n\nWhen these tiny ice crystals collide they stick together in clouds to become snowflakes. If enough ice crystals stick together, they'll become heavy enough to fall to the ground.",

Temperate coastal dwarf forest is \ncommon for parts of Southern California.  Sclerophyll Forest: Sclerophyll is a type of vegetation that has hard leaves, short internodes (the \ndistance between leaves along the stem) and leaf orientation parallel or oblique to direct sunlight. \nThe sclerophyll leaves have three leaf stress traits used to cope with hot and dry summer. \nThis type of forest is found in parts of Australia, in the Mediterranean forests and parts of south \nAfrica. \nAlpine Forests: Alpine Forests occur at altitudes ranging between 2,900 to 3,500 metres. These \nforests can be divided into: (1) sub-alpine; (2) moist alpine scrub and (3) dry alpine scrub. It is a \nmixture of coniferous and broad-leaved trees in which the coniferous trees attain a height of about \n30 m while the broad leaved trees reach only 10 m. Fir, spruce, rhododendron, etc. are important \nspecies. \nMontane Forest: Montane Forest grows at a height of 1800 to 3000 m above sea level. Mean annual \nrainfall is 150 cm to 300 cm. The trunks have large girth. Branches are clothed with mosses, ferns \nand other epiphytes. The trees rarely achieve a height of more than 6 metres. Deodar, Chilauni, \nIndian chestnut, birch, plum, machilus, cinnamomum, litsea, magnolia, blue pine, oak, hemlock, \netc. are important species.  \nIn India, Montane Forest is found in higher hills of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, in the Eastern Himalayan \nregion.",

But sometimes due to local conditions, the temperature, instead of \ndecreasing, increases with height. This phenomenon is called temperature inversion. This is \nalso known as negative lapse rate. \n\nThis inversion however, disappears with sunrise. The duration and height of surface \ninversion increases pole wards. Following conditions are required for ground surface \ninversion: \n#Long winter nights \n#Cloudless calm skies \n#Dry air and low relative humidity \n#Calm atmosphere or slow movement of air \n#Snow covered surface \n \n2) Upper air inversion: it occurs when the warm air is transported upwards into the cold air \ndue to eddies. It may be caused due to compression of the descending air as it happens \nin the case of subtropical high pressure belts. \n3) Frontal inversion: it is caused by horizontal and vertical movement of air. The temperate \ncyclones are formed by convergence of warm westerlies and cold polar air, and thus the \nwarm air overlies the cold air. The presence of warm air above and cold air below \nreverses the normal lapse rate and inversion of temperature occurs. \n \nSocial relevance of temperature inversion: \nThe inversion of temperature and its duration affects adversely the society and economy of \nthe region of its occurrence. Some of the important consequences of temperature inversion \nare- \n1) Occurance of fog: there develops clouds in contact with the ground(fog) with visibility \nusually restricted less than 1km. in the urban areas, the fog mixed with smoke takes the \nshape of smog. While fog is injurious to crops, the smog is considered as a health hazard.  \nIn 1952, about 4000 people died of smog in London. Breathing problems, asthma and \nbronchitis etc are common problem in Delhi and big cities of the northern india during \nthe winter season. \n2) Road accidents: the frequency of road, railways and air accidents increases during foggy \nconditions due to low visibility. The trains and flights are often delayed. \n3) Damage of crops: the winter crops like wheat, barley, mustard, vegetables, chilies, \npotato etc are seriously damaged. The sugarcane crop in the northern plains of India. \nEspecially in UP, Punjab and Haryana develops the disease of red rod which reduces the \nsugar content. \n4) Vegetation: Orchards are closely influenced by the inversion of temperature.

Lighter aggregate materials such as very fine sand, silt, clay and organic \nmatter are easily removed by the raindrop splash and runoff water; greater raindrop energy \nor runoff amounts are required to move larger sand and gravel particles. \nSoil movement by rainfall (raindrop splash) is usually greatest and most noticeable during \nshort-duration, high-intensity thunderstorms.  \n \nSheet Erosion \nSheet erosion is the movement of soil from raindrop splash and runoff water. It typically \noccurs evenly over a uniform slope and goes unnoticed until most of the productive topsoil \nhas been lost. Deposition of the eroded soil occurs at the bottom of the slope or in low \nareas. \nRill Erosion \nRill erosion results when surface water runoff concentrates, forming small yet well-defined \nchannels. These distinct channels where the soil has been washed away are called rills when \nthey are small enough to not interfere with field machinery operations. In many cases, rills \nare filled in each year as part of tillage operations. \nGully Erosion \nGully erosion is an advanced stage of rill erosion where surface channels are eroded to the \npoint where they become a nuisance factor in normal tillage operations \n \n \n",

The ionized electrons behave as free particles. The Sun's upper atmosphere, the \ncorona, is very hot and produces a constant stream of plasma and UV and X-rays that flow \nout from the Sun and affect, or ionize, the Earth's ionosphere. Only half the Earth’s \nionosphere is being ionized by the Sun at any time. \n \nDuring the night, without interference from the Sun, cosmic rays ionize the ionosphere, \nthough not nearly as strongly as the Sun.

        "hint": "Baba Ram Chandra \n\nBaba Ram Chandra (born 1864) was an Indian trade unionist who organised the farmers of Oudh, India into forming a united front to fight against the abuses of landlords in 1920s and 1930s. He was also an influential figure in the history of Fiji, and owed his inspiration to take up the cause of the down-trodden to his 12 years as an indentured labourer in Fiji and to his efforts to end the indenture system. His real name was Shridhar Balwant Jodhpurkar. He was a Brahmin, of Maharashtrian origin. He left for Fiji as an indentured labourer in 1904 after changing his name to Ram Chandra Rao in order to conceal his identity as a Brahmin, since Brahmins were not preferred as indentured labourers. \nOn his return to India he settled in Ayodhya and became a sadhu (holy man). He was \naccused by the local police of spreading disaffection among the peasantry. He married a woman of middle caste and commenced calling himself \"Baba Ram Chandra.\" He moved around the region with a copy of the Ramayana under his arm, blending readings from this popular Hindu epic with denunciations of both the British Raj and the landlords, and appealed to the peasants to act together against their exploiters. Although he began by seeking to harmonise tenant-landlord relations, Ram Chandra soon considered this to be a wasted effort and began to mobilise the peasants. He encouraged peasants to pay only the required rent and refrain from customary donations. \nIn 1919 he led the first peasant protest against the landlords and by 1920 had organised all the farmers associations in Oudh, forming the Oudh Kisan Sabha (Oudh Farmers’ Association). He was arrested on a number of occasions for organising public protests. \nHe tried to get the support of Nehru and other Indian National Congress leaders to fight for the rights of the farmers but was disappointed to discover that the Congress, with its urban-based leadership, was concerned only with independence and did not seem to understand the needs of the peasants.",

She was sent to London along with Annie Besant, President of Home Rule League and Women's Indian Association, to present the case for the women's vote to the Joint Select Committee. \nShe took part in the National Movement, became a follower of Gandhiji (Mahatma Gandhi) and fought for the attainment of Swaraj. She became the President of Indian National Congress at Kanpur session in 1925. She was the first Indian woman to hold the post. She accompanied Gandhi to London for the inconclusive second session of the Round Table Conference for Indian–British cooperation (1931). Later she was appointed the Governor of the United Provinces, now Uttar Pradesh.  \nKnown as the 'Nightingale of India', Sarojini Naidu also led an active literary life and attracted notable Indian intellectuals to her famous salon in Bombay. In 1914 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Her collected poems, all of which she wrote in English, have been published under the titles The Sceptred Flute (1928) and The Feather of the Dawn (1961). \nKadambini Ganguly – \nKadambini Ganguly and Chandramukhi Basu were the first two female graduates from India and the entire British Empire.

They were actively involved in female emancipation and social movements to improve work conditions of female coal miners in eastern India. \nShe was one of the six female delegates to the fifth session of the Indian National Congress in 1889.

When the Partition of Bengal divided the country in 1906, Kadambini organized the Women’s Conference in Calcutta for solidarity and served as its president in 1908. In the same year, she openly supported the Satyagraha and mobilised people to raise funds to support the workers. She served as the President of Transvaal Indian Association formed after the imprisonment of Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa and worked tirelessly for Indians there.

One of the reasons that the Drain theory is attributed to Naoroji is his decision to estimate the net national profit of India, and by extension, the effect that colonisation has on the country. Through his work with economics, Naoroji sought to prove that Britannia was draining money out of India. Naoroji described 6 factors which resulted in the external drain.  \n Firstly, India is governed by a foreign government.  \n Secondly, India does not attract immigrants which bring labour and capital for economic growth.  \n Thirdly, India pays for Britain's civil administrations and occupational army.  \n Fourthly, India bears the burden of empire building in and out of its borders.  \n Fifthly, opening the country to free trade was actually a way to exploit India by offering highly paid jobs to foreign personnel.  \n Lastly, the principal income-earners would buy outside of India or leave with the money as they were mostly foreign personnel.  \nIn Naoroji's book 'Poverty' he estimated a 200–300 million pounds loss of India's revenue to Britain that is not returned.

This organisation was established to carry out revolutionary activities against the British Empire in India with the objective of achieving independence. Since the organisation needed money for purchase of weaponry, Bismil and his party decided to plunder a train on one of the Northern Railway lines. \nIt is believed that they looted that specific train because train was supposed to carry the money bags belonging to the British Government Treasury in the guard's cabin. One passenger was killed by an accidental shot, making it a murder case. They looted only these bags containing some 8,000 rupees and escaped to Lucknow while not a single Indian was looted, because the targets of the mission were: \n To get money for the organisation which was intended to be taken from the opponent, the British Administration itself \n To get some public attention by creating a positive image of the HRA among Indians to overcome the bad image created by British Administration \n To shake the British Administration by robbing money from them \nFollowing the incident, the British administration started an intense manhunt and arrested several of the revolutionaries involved in the HRA.

It established local traditions of resistance to British rule which were to pave \nthe way for the modern national movement.  \nHindu Muslim Unity Factor- During the entire revolt, there was complete cooperation \nbetween Hindus and Muslims at all levels- people, soldiers, leaders. All rebels acknowledged \nBahadur Shah Zafar, a Muslim, as the emperor and the first impulse of the Hindu sepoys at \nMeerut was to march to Delhi, the Mughal imperial Capital. Rebel and sepoys, both Hindu \nand Muslims, respected each other’s sentiments. Immediate banning of cow slaughter was \nordered once the revolt was successful in a particular area. Both Hindus and Muslims were \nwell represented in leadership, for instance Nana Saheb had Azimullah, a Muslim and an \nexpert in political propaganda, as an aide, while Laxmibai had the solid support of Afghan \nSoldiers.

At the time of the Government of India Resolution in 1913 there were only five universities in India and the number of colleges was beyond the control of the various universities within their territorial limits. As a result, different administrative problems piled up in that period. \nTherefore, it became a necessity to reform the Indian Universities also. All these circumstances led to the formation of the Second University Commission. i.e., Calcutta University Commission in 1917 and report on the problems of university education. The Commission is also known as the Sadler Commission after the name of its chairman Dr. Michael E. Sadler. Due to the suggestions of this Commission a number of new universities were opened in the country. Of these, the universities at Patna, Osmania, Aligarh, Dacca, Lucknow, Delhi, Agra, Nagpur, Hyderabad and Annamalai may be mentioned.

Amongst all such tragedies, a terrible bout of famine struck parts of South India in 1877. In May 1878, Lord Lytton appointed a Famine Commission with Sir Richard Strachey (1817-1908) as President and Sir Charles A. Elliott (1835-1911) as Secretary. The Commission was charged to investigate the impact of the famine on vital statistics, to suggest the character of future relief programmes, to outline criteria for complimentary relief, to clarify the Government's role in the supply and distribution of food and to project the expected benefit of railway and irrigation projects. The Commission recommended: \n1. A famine code should be formulated. \n2. Irrigation facilities should be developed. \n3. Collection of land revenue should be suspended immediately during famines and land revenue should be remitted. \n4. Data should be collected about the conditions of Indian peasantry and agriculture. \n5.

The \nGovernment appointed George Campbell Commission to investigate the causes of famine and to recommend measures to prevent recurrences in future. \nThe Committee held government system responsible for creating the famine like conditions and suggested that the government during famine times must organize the relief measures. \nThe committee also recommended that steps should be taken for employment generation immediately so that the impact of famine could be mitigated. \nThe recommendations of Campbell committee were not given much attention and consequently a serious famine reoccurred in many parts of country including Punjab, UP and Madras in 1876.

His scheme of local self-government developed the Municipal institutions which had been growing up in the country ever since India was occupied by the British Crown. He led a series of enactments in which larger powers of the Local self-government were given to the rural and urban bodies and the elective people received some wider rights. Lord Ripon is known as Father of Local Self Government in India. This was not enacted by any act, it was a resolution that was passed in 1882. \nLord Ripon repealed the Vernacular Press Act of 1878 passed by Lord Lytton Mayo's Resolution of 1870: The Indian Council of Act of 1861 introduced the policy of legislative devolution and Mayo's Resolution of 1870 on financial decentralisation was its likely consequence.

The truce period, it was argued, would enable the masses to recoup their strength to fight and also give the Government a chance to respond to the demands of the nationalists. The masses could not go on sacrificing indefinitely. If the Government did not respond positively, the movement could be resumed again with the participation of the masses. This was the Struggle-Truce-Struggle or S-T-S strategy. \nCriticizing the S-T-S strategy, Nehru argued that the Indian national movement had reached a stage, after the Lahore Congress call for purna swaraj programme, in which there should, be a continuous confrontation and conflict with imperialism till it was overthrown. He advocated maintenance of a \"continuous direct action\" policy by the Congress and without the interposition of a constitutionalist phase. Real power, he said, cannot be won by two annas and four annas. Against a S-T-S strategy, he suggested a Struggle-Victory (S-V) strategy. \n\nThe \"carrot and stick\" approach (also \"carrot or stick approach\") is an idiom that refers to a policy of offering a combination of reward and punishment to induce good behavior. It is named in reference to a cart driver dangling a carrot in front of a mule and holding a stick behind it. The mule would move towards the carrot because it wants the reward of food, while also moving away from the stick behind it, since it does not want the punishment of pain, thus drawing the cart. \nEven the Britishers used this policy to deal with the emergence of Extremists during \nthe “Swadeshi Movement”.
